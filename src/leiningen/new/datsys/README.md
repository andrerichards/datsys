Welcome to your new Datsys application!

## Usage

Execute `lein repl` and when that finishes booting execute `(run)` from the REPL.
You should get some data loading on the client when you hit <localhost:{{server-port}}>.

From here:
* go to `checkouts/schema.edn` and `checkouts/test-data.edn` to start tinkering around with the data
* go to `cljs/{{ns-name}}/views.cljs` to modify the views
* go to `dev/user.clj` for a clj REPL scratch pad
* have fun!
